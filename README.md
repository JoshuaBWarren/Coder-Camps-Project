Using Fullstack, I wanted to create a web app that would allow the user to search for reviews of a given restaurant
as well as objects for purchase, from multiple sites such as Yelp, Facebook, and Google.  

The user puts in the address of the restaurant as well as the name.  User can then input
the amount of stars they'd like to see.  Hitting search pulls up a list of reviews for the 
given restaurant.

Currently, the app uses Yelp's API which only allows for a list of 40 reviews.  

Future goals:

-set up the function of allowing a user to indicate what star of reviews they want to see.
-set up the app to allow for the searching of reviews for objects to be purchased.
-clean up the display for how reviews are seen by the user.
